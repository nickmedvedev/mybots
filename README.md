# This is my final version of the random snake generation

To Run the snake simulation, you can use the terminal and enter the directory where the files are, typing in "python3 search.py" 
Alternatively you could also run button.py in a similar way

Since the possible snakes are very random, I'd recommend running the simulation multiple times.

What I did:

I created an unspecified number of links, each having its own unique size. Then, an array was created to hold all the relevant sensor bodies.

Lastly, the brain of the program was constructed, enabling a random selection of the sensors to be connected to every related motor in the system.
